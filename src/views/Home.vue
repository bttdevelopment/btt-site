          The science behind Brain Tunnelgenix Technologies Corp.™ is a paradigm
          shift. While all thermometers measure body temperature, this
          technology delivers the most precise measurement by measuring the
          brain – the most important temperature of the body. This is because
          the brain controls all autonomic systems.

            The body is a machine moved by heat, but for the past 300 years, physicians and other caregivers have measured heat in all the wrong places. Though thermometers have undergone incremental improvements, they still have major shortcomings that produce inaccurate data.

The brain thermal tunnel revolutionizes the way that we understand heat. It makes use of a biological, bi-directional tunnel that starts at the intersection of the nose and eyebrow where thermal signature patterns are captured from the brain. With that information, our engineers, scientists, and researchers develop diagnostics, therapies, & ____ to control the brain thermal tunnel _____ (fitness, hydration, treatment, etc.)
