          <p class="block">At Yale, he discovered the brain thermal tunnel, which for the first time in history enabled non-invasive, continuous measurement of human brain temperature.  Dr. Abreu has studied brain thermodynamics for over two decades and   invented technologies that resulted in dozens of patents. Abreu is one of the world’s foremost experts on body thermal energy. He developed the BTT™ Abreu 700 system, an FDA-cleared, computer microsensor that measures brain temperature. The BTT™ Abreu 700 provides the most accurate and true brain temperature without corrective factors found in all other digital and infrared thermometers.</p>
          <p class="block">Brain Tunnelgenix Technologies™ Corp., a MedTech company, utilizes advanced sensors, software, and artificial intelligence to uniquely capture brain thermodynamic signatures. </p>
          <p class="block">While at Harvard University, at the behest of the US Government’s Department of Defense, Air Force division, he developed an advanced cold laser system, patented an Opto-electromagnetic tonometric system and licensed to Nestlé’s pharmaceutical unit, Alcon Laboratories. At Alcon, Abreu also discovered the Radiation Signature of Glucose within the mid-infrared wavelength, irradiated as thermal energy from the body.</p>
