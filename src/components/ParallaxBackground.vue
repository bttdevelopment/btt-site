          We are a MedTech company with a large portfolio of intellectual property based on Dr. Marc Abreuâ€™s game-changing biological discovery, the brain thermal tunnel. The brain thermal tunnel is a bidirectional, insulated, pathway between the surface of the body, at the superomedial orbit, and the hypothalamus, our bodies thermal regulator. This discovery enables us to measure brain temperature continuously and noninvasively.
 
Our discovery allows us for the first time in history to measure brain temperature, as opposed to body temperature, giving us unparalleled insight into the understanding of the brain and its functionality.  The brain, a thermodynamic engine, is one of the last frontiers of science and we are on the precipice of understanding it in new and exciting ways.
