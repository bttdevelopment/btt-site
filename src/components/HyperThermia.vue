    <h4>BTT™ Heat Shock or Hyperthermia Treatment</h4>
    <p>
      Using BTT™ Corp’s. innovative technology, the BTT ™ Biomedical and
      Research Institute treats historically incurable neurodegenerative
      diseases with the objective of inducing heat shock protein production
      through brain-guided hyperthermia.

    <p>
      BTT™ Brain-guided Advanced Hyperthermia (BgAH) is based on technology
      derived from the FDA-Cleared Abreu BTT™ 700 System, which is the driver of
      the continuous brain temperature monitoring by the BTT™ Module.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BTT™ BgAH System consists of 2 interdependent modules: the BTT™ Control Module and the BTT™ Heat Shock Unit.  In this treatment, Dr. Abreu treats the individual with whole body hyperthermia for extended periods of time with the goal of inducing heat shock proteins, the human bodies most ubiquitous proteins, to unfold the misfolded proteins causing the neurodegenerative disease. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have treated multiple diseases using this treatment, such as Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, Alzheimer’s, Disease, Ataxia and Lyme’s Disease.
